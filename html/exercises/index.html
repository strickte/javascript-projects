      The final project I have in mind is a budget website. In a perfect world,
      you could link your bank account and credit card, but that might be too
      ambitious for a beginner; lots of security concerns. Ideally, there is a
      way to track how much you earn monthly, set out budget goals, expenses,
      and for-fun spending. Perhaps, enter estimated expenses and finalize them
      when you get the actual bill. When money is spent, it either is
      categorized into "Needs" or "Wants" and there is a way to track what
      percentage os your monthly spending is going to each category. Savings are
      seperated and tracked to see how fast you are builing to your goals.
